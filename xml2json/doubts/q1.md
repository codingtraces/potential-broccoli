1. Architecture Overview:
   - What's the overall architecture for integrating Thor with OpenText?
   - Possible solution: Microservices architecture with Spring Boot applications

2. Data Flow:
   - How should data flow from Thor to OpenText?
   - Possible solution: Thor -> XML Wrapper -> JSON Converter -> OpenText

3. Input Handling:
   - How will we receive XML input from Thor?
   - Possible solutions: 
     a) REST API endpoint
     b) File-based input using a file watcher
     c) Message queue system (e.g., RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka)

4. File Storage:
   - Where should we store input and output files?
   - Possible solutions:
     a) Local file system
     b) Azure Blob Storage (Leads call, user stories creation )
     c) Distributed file system

5. Conversion Process:
   - Should conversion be real-time or batch-based?
   - Possible solutions:
     a) Real-time conversion for each request
     b) Scheduled batch processing

6. Error Handling and Logging:
   - How should we manage errors and logging?
   - Possible solution: Centralized logging system with error notifications (Leads call, user stories creation )

7. Scalability:
   - How do we ensure the system can handle increased load?
   - Possible solutions:
     a) Horizontal scaling with multiple instances
     b) Load balancing
     c) Caching mechanisms

8. Security:
   - What security measures are required?
   - Possible solutions:
     a) API authentication
     b) Data encryption in transit and at rest
     c) Network security rules

9. Deployment:
   - Where and how will the application be deployed?
   - Possible solutions:
     a) On-premises servers
     b) Cloud deployment (e.g., Azure, AWS)
     c) Containerization with Docker and Kubernetes

10. Monitoring and Maintenance:
    - How will we monitor and maintain the system?
    - Possible solution: Implement health checks and monitoring using Spring Boot Actuator

11. Testing Strategy:
    - What testing approaches should we implement?
    - Possible solutions:
      a) Unit testing with JUnit
      b) Integration testing
      c) Load testing for performance validation

12. Recipient Profile Handling:
    - How should we manage multiple recipient profiles? (Evening_leads_call_processed)
    - Possible solution: Implement a configurable mapping system for recipient data

13. Performance Requirements:
    - Are there specific performance benchmarks to meet?
    - Possible solution: Implement caching and optimize database queries

14. Integration with Existing Systems:
    - How will this integrate with current Thor and OpenText systems?
    - Possible solution: Develop adapters for seamless integration with both systems

15. Namespace and Environment Configuration:
    - How should we handle different environments and namespaces? (Scrum meeting )
    - Possible solution: Use Spring profiles for environment-specific configurations
